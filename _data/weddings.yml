# label. The label is the text that is seen when
# somebody hovers over an image, and the image
# should be the name of an image that exists in the
# "image/wedding/slideshow" folder
# (including the extension)
#
# Images should be 1000x400px dimensions, and saved
# for web (ideally as JPEG files)

# The blurb about the wedding stuff.

blurb: >
  <p>
      There is nothing that makes me happier than seeing my designs come to life in print, especially with screen printing. There is nothing that quite matches the magical feeling at the moment when I pull up the screen to reveal the finished print in all its glory. I love the process of screen printing and as I hand print all my designs I really feel part of the whole journey.

# 1000px in either width or height) and saved for web
