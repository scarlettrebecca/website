# The blurb about the wedding stuff.

blurb: >
  <p>
      For me there is nothing that quite matches the magical feeling when i'm printing; at the moment when I pull up the screen to reveal the finished print in all its glory. Printmaking is the love of my life and as I hand print all of my designs you can be sure your stationery is being made with real love and care.
  </p>
      
  <p>
      Whether you want to work together to capture your own vision in print for your special day or customise one of my lovingly created collections, we can make something completely unique to you. I work closely with the couples to co-ordinate the colours and text of my existing collections, which are completely customisable, to the colour scheme of the couple's wedding. The wedding stationery you send out to your loved ones is the first impression they will get of your big day, so letâ€™s make it unforgettable!
