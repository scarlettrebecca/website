# The slideshow. Each slide has an image and a
# label. The label is the text that is seen when
# somebody hovers over an image, and the image
# should be the name of an image that exists in the
# "image/wedding/slideshow" folder
# (including the extension)
#
# Images should be 1000x400px dimensions, and saved
# for web (ideally as JPEG files)
